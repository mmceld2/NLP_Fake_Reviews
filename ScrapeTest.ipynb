We had crab cakes, shrimp and grits and frog leg appetizers. We couldn't get pass the appetizers since we ordered so many but it was so good. The crab cakes and shrimp and grits were absolutely incredible. Next time I'm back in town I will be there again.  \n",

Bartender waited on us which resulted in poor service because he was busy serving drinks & waiting on customers at the counter.  Ordered steak medium rare, it was served seared & cold in the middle.  Ended up asking the hostess for ketchup, dressing, etc.  Suggestion: if you seat a larger party at a bar table, assign a server, not the bartender who was very nice & tried but was far too busy.  Terrible experience.  \n",

Scenic white table cloth restaurant along the river with a great selection of Cajun Seafood. Everything we ate was top notch &amp; amazing. Favorite dish was an appetizer of Oysters - I couldn't get enough. The menu is up there in price but equal to the value of the food and experience,  you won't be let down. UNIQUE: They end the meal with complimentary cotton candy, a cool touch to complete the night. Would come back!</td>\n",

       "      <td>The food was kinda good...  but the alfredo sauce and I'm not a cook but to me tasted like it came as a powder and they just added water and served. Idk if all sauces come like that but it tasted like you could taste the powder.... wasn't good at all. Then the whole 3 waiters they give you.to confusing you got one for drinks 1 for appetizers and one for food or something like that if you don't have the best memory you forget who you're asking for what. Then it's like who do I ask to give me my check the drank waiter was  more happily to do it for me. And said you can ask anyone of us it's okay... it was our anniversary and they took really good care of us..... gave us a desert with happy anniversary on it gave us champagne.... the place is beautiful.. the water front is even better. But they gotta do something about that alfredo... I love alfredo sauce. It's deffently my favorite and I try it every place I go. I don't care for olive garden besides the bread and salad and of ocurse the alfredo sauce. They have the best I've tasted. if it wasn't for the sauce I'd give  them 5 stars. Oh I completely forgot so I had to edit my review. My wife was trying to order a drank and asked the woman waiter what's good and she pointed out a drank and said this drank is the shit... like how does she know that we are okay with cuss words. You don't curse to customers. There a million other words to use other then this drank is the shit...</td>\n",

       "      <td>The food, drinks, and service were amazing, not a single complaint there. The host/seating situation could be improved... On my first visit my friend and I called ahead on a Friday around 5:30 and arrived about an hour later. We checked in with the hostess and they stated there was only one table ahead of us, but it'd still be about and hour and half wait, which we were fine with (and expected) so we happily went to the bar to visit and have a few drinks. At 9:30 we still hadn't been seated, so we went politely to check on our table and they again said \"there's only one table ahead of you, it shouldn't be too much longer.\" Unfortunately we were starving so we smiled and said thank you, but we were just going to grab something a little quicker and went to Bonefish... No problem, we both have years of experience in the service industry and understand how new restaurants are in Lafayette for the first few months, and we knew we'd be back another time. Last night we figured it wouldn't be as bad on a Wednesday so we decided to try again for his birthday. We arrived around 7 and were told the wait was about an hour---he didn't really want to wait but I convinced him-- so we again headed to the bar for some pre-dinner drinks. There were a couple bar tables open, and we're bar table kind of people, so we went and double checked with the hosts to make sure they were hosted seating and not first-come first-serve, and were reaffirmed that indeed they were hosted seating. We watched people coming and going from the bar tables and just assumed they were on the wait list before us, however there were always multiple tables open. Just over an hour later we got the text that our table was ready and headed to the hostess stand. As we were walking up a couple walked in and asked for a table for 2, the host replied that he didn't have any in the dining room at the moment, but that he did have a nice high top in the bar they could have and he walked them to their table, as we stood there and watched. We didn't make a fuss, upon his return we simply stated \"You know, it certainly would have been nice if we could have had a bar table, an hour ago, when we inquired about them. It's okay though, we're patient\". We were pretty pissed and wanted to say more, but went to our table and went on about our business. The food and service were amazing, and we thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the experience.  I definitely know to make reservations from now on, even if it's just for 2, and I certainly hope next time the seating will go a little more smoothly-- tables will be seated with the proper priority and we won't wait an hour unnecessarily!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dear A.L,Thank you so much for taking the time to write about your recent dining experience with us. I was glad to hear that you enjoyed your food and service at the table, but disappointed to hear about the frustrations and challenges you experienced at the front door. This is certainly not indicative of the Ruffino's experience that we are able to provide. We make our high top bar tables available for guest without reservations so you can enjoy dinner in a relaxed atmosphere without a reservation.  We ask that our guest check in at the Host stand where they can be seated if a table is available or added to our waitlist and quoted an approximate seating time. We obviously fell short of both our and your expectations on both occasions. I deeply apologize that your visit was not up to standard and will certainly address your concerns with our team. I would like to take the time to personally speak with you about your experiences in order to address your concerns, so please feel free to contact me or my General Manager Rene' Schnell directly at your convenience 337*706*7333.Thank you and we look forward to serving you in the future!</td>\n",

Scenic white table cloth restaurant along the river with a great selection of Cajun Seafood. Everything we ate was top notch & amazing. Favorite dish was an appetizer of Oysters - I couldn't get enough. The menu is up there in price but equal to the value of the food and experience,  you won't be let down. UNIQUE: They end the meal with complimentary cotton candy, a cool touch to complete the night. Would come back!   \n",

Idk if all sauces come like that but it tasted like you could taste the powder.... wasn't good at all. Then the whole 3 waiters they give you.to confusing you got one for drinks 1 for appetizers and one for food or something like that if you don't have the best memory you forget who you're asking for what. Then it's like who do I ask to give me my check the drank waiter was  more happily to do it for me. And said you can ask anyone of us it's okay... it was our anniversary and they took really good care of us..... gave us a desert with happy anniversary on it gave us champagne.... the place is beautiful.. the water front is even better. But they gotta do something about that alfredo... I love alfredo sauce. It's deffently my favorite and I try it every place I go. I don't care for olive garden besides the bread and salad and of ocurse the alfredo sauce. They have the best I've tasted. if it wasn't for the sauce I'd give  them 5 stars. Oh I completely forgot so I had to edit my review. My wife was trying to order a drank and asked the woman waiter what's good and she pointed out a drank and said this drank is the shit... like how does she know that we are okay with cuss words. You don't curse to customers. There a million other words to use other then this drank is the shit...   \n",

       "270  The food, drinks, and service were amazing, not a single complaint there. The host/seating situation could be improved... On my first visit my friend and I called ahead on a Friday around 5:30 and arrived about an hour later. We checked in with the hostess and they stated there was only one table ahead of us, but it'd still be about and hour and half wait, which we were fine with (and expected) so we happily went to the bar to visit and have a few drinks. At 9:30 we still hadn't been seated, so we went politely to check on our table and they again said \"there's only one table ahead of you, it shouldn't be too much longer.\" Unfortunately we were starving so we smiled and said thank you, but we were just going to grab something a little quicker and went to Bonefish... No problem, we both have years of experience in the service industry and understand how new restaurants are in Lafayette for the first few months, and we knew we'd be back another time. Last night we figured it wouldn't be as bad on a Wednesday so we decided to try again for his birthday. We arrived around 7 and were told the wait was about an hour---he didn't really want to wait but I convinced him-- so we again headed to the bar for some pre-dinner drinks. There were a couple bar tables open, and we're bar table kind of people, so we went and double checked with the hosts to make sure they were hosted seating and not first-come first-serve, and were reaffirmed that indeed they were hosted seating. We watched people coming and going from the bar tables and just assumed they were on the wait list before us, however there were always multiple tables open. Just over an hour later we got the text that our table was ready and headed to the hostess stand. As we were walking up a couple walked in and asked for a table for 2, the host replied that he didn't have any in the dining room at the moment, but that he did have a nice high top in the bar they could have and he walked them to their table, as we stood there and watched. We didn't make a fuss, upon his return we simply stated \"You know, it certainly would have been nice if we could have had a bar table, an hour ago, when we inquired about them. It's okay though, we're patient\". We were pretty pissed and wanted to say more, but went to our table and went on about our business. The food and service were amazing, and we thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the experience.  I definitely know to make reservations from now on, even if it's just for 2, and I certainly hope next time the seating will go a little more smoothly-- tables will be seated with the proper priority and we won't wait an hour unnecessarily!   \n",

I was glad to hear that you enjoyed your food and service at the table, but disappointed to hear about the frustrations and challenges you experienced at the front door. This is certainly not indicative of the Ruffino's experience that we are able to provide. We make our high top bar tables available for guest without reservations so you can enjoy dinner in a relaxed atmosphere without a reservation.  We ask that our guest check in at the Host stand where they can be seated if a table is available or added to our waitlist and quoted an approximate seating time. We obviously fell short of both our and your expectations on both occasions. I deeply apologize that your visit was not up to standard and will certainly address your concerns with our team. I would like to take the time to personally speak with you about your experiences in order to address your concerns, so please feel free to contact me or my General Manager Rene' Schnell directly at your convenience 337*706*7333.Thank you and we look forward to serving you in the future!   \n",

Disgusting, will never be back based on that alone, because who knows what else they let slide.

There were only about 6 customers there on a Friday lunch.  I got up and told him we were leaving, cancel the rest of the order.  When we got outside, the manager caught up to us saying he hoped we would come back and give them a second chance.  Not on my life!</td>\n",

It WAS NOT a service animal it was an 10 or 12 week old puppy that they were more than willing to let people pet and play with, including the staff. UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!!! Disgusting, will never be back based on that alone, because who knows what else they let slide. The food was mediocre my steak was overcooked, the \"fries\" were undercooked and under seasoned, not to mention not very many menu choices. and finally the service was alright, a guest should never be slurping melted ice to stay hydrated and have to ask for a kids menu 3 times.   \n",
       "3    One star was earned for the clean, casual surroundings and prompt service.  Downhill from there with the shrimp remoulade appetizer.  As soon as it was set down the stench of spoiled shrimp came wafting through the scant brown mustard \"remoulade\" sauce.  Any server or chef should have smelled that before serving.  A closer look showed translucent, mushy rotten smelling--probably imported and frozen- shrimp.  I called the waiter back and asked him to smell it, which he did and apologized, saying he would speak with the chef.  He returned to the customer area but never returned to the table. There were only about 6 customers there on a Friday lunch.  I got up and told him we were leaving, cancel the rest of the order.  When we got outside, the manager caught up to us saying he hoped we would come back and give them a second chance.  Not on my life!   \n",
