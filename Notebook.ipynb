The bartender (who was hot) was awesome! The French fries at this place are sick! I got 2 orders they were SO good! And George Washington drank here! It's totally true! I like Stone Street a lot and this is a couple blocks away and it's really worth going to. It's cool to go with friends or to hang out or even on a date.

The are in that awkward place between the size/price of an appetizer and the size/price of a normal main dish platter. In a regular restaurant I would maybe spend $10 on an appetizer and $20 on a main dish, and this is if I am feeling particularly hungry. Here I literally had to get two \"main dishes\" which amounted to about $35 and still left fairly hungry. If you just want an expensive but flavorful snack, this place is good. But if you are looking for a place to eat this may not be the best value. The interior is also a bit strange. It tried to pull off the ambiance of a restaurant with candles and a darkly lit setting, but the white plastic bar tables are strangely positioned and are cold in nature. Bottom line, the chef is great and the ideas behind the dishes are wonderful. But unless this place changes its value proposition it will not last long. Suggestion - keep the prices, double the size of the portions. People will flock. Good luck. Siana</td>\n",

My friends ordered several dishes (mostly non- vegan), and the aroma from each one of them stuck with me, especially garlic shrimps and thus I was back for my share and more. Both visits to Baoburg have been wonderful. The staff were not only friendly and warm, but also very attentive to guests' Â at every table. Even the owner, Chef Bao came to our table to check on us and asked for feedback in general. I personally enjoy trying out food at mom-and-pop shops, and one thing that is an absolute delight, as well as a surprise, is visibility to the kitchen - a surprise because kitchen is a busy place and one wouldn't like to expose that area to the guests, and delight because a clean and well managed kitchen suggests that hygiene is a priority for the staff. And Baoburg earns my applause for that!! Although the restaurant is small in area, it sure offers much more than just a table, chair, and food. The service is great, food is flavorful, presentation is classy and appetizing, ambiance is cosy, and the staff is personable. You don't much after a long day at work than just that. I would definitely recommend Baoburg to anyone and for sure I am coming back.</td>\n",

I come here a lot. I love to support them instead of supporting other restaraunts in manhattan. It's my favorite, great food, great service, and most of all its a revolutionary war place which is my favorite! I can't believe George Washington slept, ate, and stayed here during the 1700s ! Bowling green is nearby which is a nice historical park, as well as other revolutionary war sites you should, visit. I live nearby on Chambers St and come here a lot to support them. Please support them the. Money goes to great cause. Museum is the best upstairs too.   \n",

First of all it's like a restaurant and brew pub and sports bar and museum all wrapped into 1. The place is HUGE! The prices are cheap and there's enough room so you're not super crowded or packed in. Before the scavenger hunt I was in the back bat watching the series game and having a beer. The bartender (who was hot) was awesome! The French fries at this place are sick! I got 2 orders they were SO good! And George Washington drank here! It's totally true! I like Stone Street a lot and this is a couple blocks away and it's really worth going to. It's cool to go with friends or to hang out or even on a date. Plus they had this place as the starting point and the after party place for Zombies vs Vampires (zombiesVvampires.com if u want to check it out). Such a cool place! Laid back! Not expensive! Pretty easy to get to on the 1. I wish I knew about it before. You definitely have to try this place out.   \n",

Their porter is smooth, creamy and very, very tasty. In my opinion, it's better than Guinness. It's worth going there just for the beer. The first time I went was in the evening. Their bar food was exceptional. Their fish and chips are solid, and I liked a mushroom based vegetarian dish. I've forgotten what they're called, but you should definitely their mini-sausages wrapped in dough. In the evenings though, it can get crowded and it's hard to get your waiter's attention. My girlfriend was lucky to win a free lunch there. Their potato and leek soup was sublime and their bangers and mash were very good too.

However the biggest thing that irked me was the size of their platters. The are in that awkward place between the size/price of an appetizer and the size/price of a normal main dish platter. In a regular restaurant I would maybe spend $10 on an appetizer and $20 on a main dish, and this is if I am feeling particularly hungry. Here I literally had to get two \"main dishes\" which amounted to about $35 and still left fairly hungry. If you just want an expensive but flavorful snack, this place is good. But if you are looking for a place to eat this may not be the best value. The interior is also a bit strange. It tried to pull off the ambiance of a restaurant with candles and a darkly lit setting, but the white plastic bar tables are strangely positioned and are cold in nature. Bottom line, the chef is great and the ideas behind the dishes are wonderful. But unless this place changes its value proposition it will not last long. Suggestion - keep the prices, double the size of the portions. People will flock. Good luck. Siana   \n",

Just in the basis of the exceptional wine list, Baoburg( which stands for chef bao bao in williamsburgs) deserves a michelin stars. Each offering is so well considered for its ability to match the food or offer something special, and there a few real gems at reasonable prices. The food is, of couse, supurb, and each dish is a true work of art. But perhaps the thing that more sets Baoburg apart is the service, which perfectly strikes that balance between professionalism and sincere friendliness. Truly an experience to be missed.   \n",

This cozy intimate restaurant located in the heart of north Williamsburg was worth the trip, the staff was very friendly and the waiter made some great recommendations, but I wanted to try everything on the menu. My girlfriend and I choose to go with the Truffle fries and glazed chicken made with a maple flavor and soy sauce combination and chicken empanadas that we shared. I know for the next time to order 2 of those dishes cause it was so delicious I really did not want to share with my girlfriend..lol. Then we ordered the short ribs, this was also very tasty and the meat was very juicy and full of flavor. We ended our meal with the chocolate lava cake and a chocolate cream crape with ice cream. I will definitely go back to try the other items on the menu, and might live the girlfriend home, so It more food for me to enjoy...:) I also had the pleasure of meeting Chef Bao, she's a young and very talented chef with some cutting edge ideas for all food lovers, I'm looking forward to my next meal at Baourg.   \n",
       "111647  I recently visited Baoburg for the second time just to satiate the strong urge to taste their garlic shrimp - Gambas Al Ajillo. The first time I went to eat there, I was following a vegan diet for religious reasons. My friends ordered several dishes (mostly non- vegan), and the aroma from each one of them stuck with me, especially garlic shrimps and thus I was back for my share and more. Both visits to Baoburg have been wonderful. The staff were not only friendly and warm, but also very attentive to guests' Â at every table. Even the owner, Chef Bao came to our table to check on us and asked for feedback in general. I personally enjoy trying out food at mom-and-pop shops, and one thing that is an absolute delight, as well as a surprise, is visibility to the kitchen - a surprise because kitchen is a busy place and one wouldn't like to expose that area to the guests, and delight because a clean and well managed kitchen suggests that hygiene is a priority for the staff. And Baoburg earns my applause for that!! Although the restaurant is small in area, it sure offers much more than just a table, chair, and food. The service is great, food is flavorful, presentation is classy and appetizing, ambiance is cosy, and the staff is personable. You don't much after a long day at work than just that. I would definitely recommend Baoburg to anyone and for sure I am coming back.   \n",

Â , the chicken was refried. It was not fresh. Â Worst of all, there were 2 or 3 Â black \"pellets \" in the waffels that in my opinion Â looked like droppings. Did not look like pieces of burnt left over pancake like the lady who works therre described it when i called to tell them. Â It appears to me that something coul have fell into the batter. I threw it away. Â So what they got an A in the window, the chicken an waffels were , expensive, refried and tasteless with suspicious black pellets that was fried in the waffle.

However its not really a restaurant, only had three small tables n, paper plates.more of a take out joint, or jus coffee/tea n or dessert.   \n",

Had the fish dinner. It came with 2 sides. Â I chose the collard greens and potato salad. I am happy to say the food was delicious. Â The ordered came in the specified time. The delivery guy was nice. Brought the food to my door. Â I had the crumb apple pie for dessert. Â The only think missing was I didn't have any ice cream at home to top it off. Â I definitely would order from here again.   \n",

The place was empty and very clean. Â To good to be true kinda thing! Â My better half ordered a fried chicken dinner, my daughter ordered the honey BBQ wings and I ordered the fish & shrimp dinner with a side of red velvet cake. Â Well, when we Â got home and started eating. . . OH, MY GOODNESS!! We looked at each other like WOW I don't believe it. Â We finally hit the JACKPOT and it is located around the corner from my home. Â  If you want Real Down Home Southern Cuisine. Please make your way to Napoleon Southern Cuisine & Bakery on Bedford Ave Between Putnam and Madison. Delicious!!!   \n",

Â I ordered the smothered chicken with mac & cheese and rice and gravy with a lemonade and banana bread pudding for dessert. Â The meat was so tender it was falling off the bone, the mac & cheese was perfect and the banana bread pudding (which is made from scratch) was one of a kind! Denise was very helpful and friendly and Napoleon himself even came out to speak with us. Â I look forward to going back very soon!   \n",

The honey bbq wings and mac and cheese are to die for, and once I tried it other places in the neighborhood paled in comparison. This family owned restaurant will satisfy any craving for a homey slice of southern comfort. Â Also, dont miss out on the top notch cakes and pastries--More cheese biscuits please!   \n",

    "After doing a little more research, I found out that Yelp also classifies them as 'recommended' or 'not recommended'. https://www.reviewtrackers.com/blog/fake-yelp-reviews/ is the website I discovered this at. Each post is carefully vetted by employees at Yelp. At the current state of that article(Jan 2019), 70% are recommended while 30% are not. Long rants are put in the non recommended, along with those that seem solicitated. They want all reviews to be genuine, without a restaraunt trying to boost their ratings in a disingenuous manner. Yelp also has more information such as which computers the reviews came from and activity of the users.\n",

    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdG81QKdga0 is a link to a video where 5 star reviews are sold to businesses. There are Facebook groups where you can go to find people who will boost your score, with the 'elite' reviews being premium since they cannot be removed. This video is from September of 2020. This is why the fake reviews are so hard to spot. They are actual people writing these for money boosting the business rating. This leads to the question, can you also pay a group of people to bring down a competing business?"

I went into the store because earlier that day, I was CRAVING for some chicken and waffles. I went on yelp because I was going to go to Sweet Chick to test it out, but I work all the way in the Bronx and when I'm off, I don't like traveling and Williamsburg was a stretch from Crown Heights that day. I'm sorry. I see this place on Yelp that's right around the corner so I take the bus and I'm on the hunt. I go into the store that is EXTREMELY clean. I tell the guy that I want the red velvet waffles and chicken wings plus the sweet tea and a side of macaroni and cheese. I have a seat, drooling with anticipation. I almost cried when he set the food in front of me. The red velvet waffle had a sweet cream cheese glaze and it was so good. I asked for syrup on the side, but it wasn't needed. Not too sweet, but it was good. It was just right. BEST WAFFLE I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! And trust me, I know my way around waffles. Damn a pancakes and DAMN a French toast! I had to order a second waffle. I also had a homemade half and half and It was the best I've ever had in New York State. (Just needs some Jack Daniel's Honey to mix with!) Come to find out that the guy that was serving me was the owner! I LOVE to see a business where the owner is hands on. Just a pleasant and humble person. Respect will get you places money won't. Because the owner is a humble man, his restaurant will flourish. I pray this is so, he deserves it. And he's from Birmingham, AL! It shows in his cooking. Â I wanted to try the banana pudding that was in the window but I didn't have the space. Maybe next year. Fuck am I kidding? I'm cancelling the NYSC membership and I'm at Napoleon's TOMORROW!!!!!!

Â The meat was juicy, mouth watering, and moist. Â The skin was crispy, crunchy, and extremely flavorful. Â The waffles we fluffy and covered in butter and powered sugar, with syrup on the side to smother at my will. Â SO, SO YUMMY! Â If that wasn't enough, my boyfriend ordered the Honey Barbeque Chicken dinner plate which comes with two sides, he ordered mac &amp; cheese and candied yams. Â The honey barbeque sauce was to die for! Extremely orgasmic to say the least. Â You will NEVER desire another. Â To top off the exceptional dinner, we had the sweet potato cheesecake which again was phenomenal, for lack of words. Â Napoleon came out to check up on us, asking if everything was alright. Â We couldn't stop complimenting his cooking/baking skills.. the love he puts into his food is above all and one can really see that with every taste that poured into our mouths. Â He was very sweet, as was the cashier. Â I plan to recommend this restaurant to EVERYONE that crosses my way, it really is that GREAT!!</td>\n",

Granted it's a new spot and they are getting Â things together but their menu is disappointingly inconsistent, their shelves are mostly empty and... what no coffee? \"The machine was turned off, this is not a coffee shop\", Â well there's is something called instant coffee, just add water... This place has an exceptional baker and a throw down cook, once you get over the emptiness and them not having what you came for..... You will love what they have.</td>\n",

I got excited reading the reviews because Napoleon is not far from my house. So rushed from work to get her and the food was beyond disappointing. I had the fried fish mac and cheese and the collards. Fish under cooked and bland...I didn't taste an ounce of seasoning I had to use the tarter sauce for that. Mac and cheese I can't put my finger on the cheese but it taste powdery like Â a combination of kraft mac and cheese with real cheese added for good measure. Colards wouldn't have been bad if they weren't salty The young lady said she knew I would come back...I think not. I could have had end if the day food and theres a chance it may be better during regular hours...but I don't want to find out.   \n",
       "111782  I don't think that I will be going back for the rest of the year. Here's why: THE FOOD IS TOO GOOD!!!!!!!!! Do you understand what that means? THE F-O-O-D is G-O-O-D! I went into the store because earlier that day, I was CRAVING for some chicken and waffles. I went on yelp because I was going to go to Sweet Chick to test it out, but I work all the way in the Bronx and when I'm off, I don't like traveling and Williamsburg was a stretch from Crown Heights that day. I'm sorry. I see this place on Yelp that's right around the corner so I take the bus and I'm on the hunt. I go into the store that is EXTREMELY clean. I tell the guy that I want the red velvet waffles and chicken wings plus the sweet tea and a side of macaroni and cheese. I have a seat, drooling with anticipation. I almost cried when he set the food in front of me. The red velvet waffle had a sweet cream cheese glaze and it was so good. I asked for syrup on the side, but it wasn't needed. Not too sweet, but it was good. It was just right. BEST WAFFLE I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! And trust me, I know my way around waffles. Damn a pancakes and DAMN a French toast! I had to order a second waffle. I also had a homemade half and half and It was the best I've ever had in New York State. (Just needs some Jack Daniel's Honey to mix with!) Come to find out that the guy that was serving me was the owner! I LOVE to see a business where the owner is hands on. Just a pleasant and humble person. Respect will get you places money won't. Because the owner is a humble man, his restaurant will flourish. I pray this is so, he deserves it. And he's from Birmingham, AL! It shows in his cooking. Â I wanted to try the banana pudding that was in the window but I didn't have the space. Maybe next year. Fuck am I kidding? I'm cancelling the NYSC membership and I'm at Napoleon's TOMORROW!!!!!! Love and life.   \n",

Unfortunately, it took them 2 hours to deliver the food when they originally estimated 35-45 mins, that knocked down the 4th star. The chicken was DARN good! We'll skip the fries next time, they were super soggy and greasy with a slice of american cheese melted on top. Unfortunately we couldn't tell if the red velvet waffle was good or not, it sweated on the way to us so it was super soggy, but regardless, we devoured it! The bf ordered a \"chicken breast\" smother sandwich, the chicken was on the bun, it's not really a sandwich, it came with 2 slices of \"whole wheat slice bread\", the bf would have preferred white. We will definitely give this place a try again.   \n",

Â The food is AMAZING the owner and his wife are the nicest people you could ever meet. Â  I've eaten just about some of everything (turkey legs, shrimp, oxtails, chicken wings, potato salad, greens, Mac n cheese, cookies, pies and cakes) and I've never been disappointed. Only killer is the street parking, but for those out there who can actually parallel park this shouldn't be a problem. Go and be sure to bring an appetite because it is sooooooooo worth it!   \n",

I knew that I was tired as the same old crap. After searching for restaurants on yelp, I decided that I was in the mood for chicken and waffles. So, I seen that Napoleon's Southern Cuisine and Bakery had a high rate. When I read the reviews, the reviews was describing the red velvet waffles. I never heard of red velvet waffles. I go theree and ordered the red velvet waffle w/ chicken wings and a slice of sweet potato cheesecake. I took the food home and I hulk smash the food. The food was great. The red velvet waffle w/ the butter cream on top was like biting into slice of erotica. The waffle was moist and the chicken was seasoned and cooked right. This restaurant has my business and I will return for more great food.   \n",

The food was great, I would definitely go back. Their hours are not as long as most places but worth the visit when they are open.   \n",

I came here with my lady to try it out because we were both in the mood for some red velvet waffles and fried chicken and we found this place on yelp. the fried chicken wings were perfectly fried and the red velvet waffles were fresh, a little crispy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. i was too full to try their cakes but my Â girlfriend bought a slice of their red velvet and It was awesome (ran back and bought me a slice to take home). my only complaint was the mac cheese looks like it was reheated (but tasted good) but I I will definitely be a regular here.   \n",

I've had jerk chicken, oxtail and fried chicken. I love the oxtail the most. The only things that I don't totally love is that the place doesn't have too many tables so you have to do take out most of the time. The tables are mostly used by people waiting for takeout. I also think that they could be more clear about their hours. Several times I have tried to go but it was closed. But, the people who work here are incredibly friendly and care about the food they make and serve, the food itself is delicious and authentic and not too greasy or salty. Get collard greens and oxtail, those are my favorites.   \n",

Â Delivery took a little over an hour which would usually send me into a crazy hAngry tizzy but there was a torrential down pour and the delivery man was very nice and even blew me a kiss went he left. Â *Secures top safety lock on door* I ordered the chicken and red velvet waffles. Â Waffles were tasty and the chicken was good too. They placed the chicken on top of the waffles as if you were dining in. I kinda wish they would have separated the two so that the waffles weren't soaking up all the grease. Â My sister ordered the traditional chicken and waffles and we swapped a quarter. Â Best decision of the night. Â That waffle right there was infused with butter. Â It was so rich that it reminded me of funnel cake at a street fair. Â I swear the traditional waffle complimented the chicken even better. Â We also ordered a side of mac and cheese which was good. Â The grand finale may have upstaged the entree. Â Carrot cake with the lightest, fluffliest cream cheese dressing completed my meal. I saw other reviews that commented on the portions. Â Don't be fooled by the \"mini waffles.\" Â It's one helluva waffle divided in four. Â My meal was comfortably split in 2. Happy chicken eating!   \n",

Of COURSE I had to celebrate Record Store day with the food of the South :-). Really good chicken and waffles, one star off for the prices -- $14 seems like a lot for a waffle and 4 chicken wings -- it was called '4 mini waffles' on the menu but it was one regular sized waffle, and I ordered a breast and thigh dinner as well because I prefer to have some chicken breast with my waffles, and the one breast that came with the dinner was too small for two people to share even just as a taste.   \n",

The service is really a major plus. I felt like I walked into my aunt's house or something. I've tried a few of the items on the menu but the standout by far would be the honey bbq wings. They are so sweet and tangy! I have not had wings that juicy and good in a very long time. The homemade baked good are equally stellar. I hate cheesecake, but the sweet potato cheesecake here changed my mind! The yellow cake with chocolate frosting, the lemon cake all hits! Any of the sides you choose for your meal will be well seasond and tasty! Wash it all down with a hal and half and you will be in heaven. I have not tried the breakfast and to be honest I am scared to do it. Grits, salmon cakes, waffles with nutella...These things could be a major wardrobe shrinker. I am very confident that when I do, it will be worth every calorie. Get yourself over there ASAP!!   \n",

Â I've had tried plenty since I've moved to NY, but NONE compare to Napoleons!! Â I ordered the 4 mini waffles and wings dinner plate (substituting the wings for a leg and breast). Â The meat was juicy, mouth watering, and moist. Â The skin was crispy, crunchy, and extremely flavorful. Â The waffles we fluffy and covered in butter and powered sugar, with syrup on the side to smother at my will. Â SO, SO YUMMY! Â If that wasn't enough, my boyfriend ordered the Honey Barbeque Chicken dinner plate which comes with two sides, he ordered mac & cheese and candied yams. Â The honey barbeque sauce was to die for! Extremely orgasmic to say the least. Â You will NEVER desire another. Â To top off the exceptional dinner, we had the sweet potato cheesecake which again was phenomenal, for lack of words. Â Napoleon came out to check up on us, asking if everything was alright. Â We couldn't stop complimenting his cooking/baking skills.. the love he puts into his food is above all and one can really see that with every taste that poured into our mouths. Â He was very sweet, as was the cashier. Â I plan to recommend this restaurant to EVERYONE that crosses my way, it really is that GREAT!!   \n",

They seem fixated on cleanliness, which is a good thing but can I Â finish my delicious chicken and waffles...please!!! Granted it's a new spot and they are getting Â things together but their menu is disappointingly inconsistent, their shelves are mostly empty and... what no coffee? \"The machine was turned off, this is not a coffee shop\", Â well there's is something called instant coffee, just add water... This place has an exceptional baker and a throw down cook, once you get over the emptiness and them not having what you came for..... You will love what they have.   \n",
