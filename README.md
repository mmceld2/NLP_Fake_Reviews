# NLP_Fake_Reviews

# Business Problem

How many times have you read reviews while searching for places to eat and not thinking twice about whether or not the review was left by a real person? I would think that answer is very often. Most of the time, we make snap decisions on a few of the reviews. Fake reviews can falsely hurt or boost a restaurants reputation on a review website, and deter customers from visiting restaurants. An extra star on somewhere like Yelp can increase revenue by 5-9 percent. This is false advertising. The intergity of the site is important, and people need to be able to trust the reviews they read. There are places you can go to purchase reviews for a business. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdG81QKdga0 is a video showing how reviews can be bought or sold. There needs to be a barrier in place in order to detect this fraudulent behavior.
 
A model using NLP(Natural Language Processing) can be used to flag reviews as they are posted to be peer reviewed by a person. Since this is designed to flag a review to be peer reviewed, it will be better for the model to predict more false positives (or reviews that the model thinks is fake but is not). This scoring metric is called recall. This model can help protect any review website wanting to improve review integrity.
